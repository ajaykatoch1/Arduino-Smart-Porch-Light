# Arduino-Smart-Porch-Light
This project is a smart porch light made with an ATmega2560 and VScode. 
It uses a proximity sensor and ambient light sensor. 
So when it is night time and a vehicle or person comes with 10 meters of the porch light it turns on for a programmed amount of time.

// Description: Main code for a smart porch light sensor using an
//              Arduino Mega 2560 and SI115x sensor for ambient light sensing
//              and proximity sensing
//
// Requirements: When something is close in front of the sensor as determined
//              by the proximity sensor, if the ambient light levels are low
//              enough (ie: it is dark out), the light (a red LED) turns on
